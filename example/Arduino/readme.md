# Library Descriptions

## Crowbits_DHT20
The Crowbits_DHT20 library is designed for interfacing with the DHT20 temperature and humidity sensor. It provides functions to read temperature and humidity data from the sensor.

## DHT20
This library supports the DHT20 digital temperature and humidity sensor, offering functionalities to measure environmental parameters accurately.

## lvgl
LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) is a free and open-source graphics library that allows developers to create rich user interfaces on embedded systems with limited resources.

## TFT_eSPI-master
TFT_eSPI-master is an advanced library for driving TFT displays using SPI communication. It supports various display models and offers extensive features for rendering text, images, and shapes.

## Ticker
The Ticker library enables the creation of timing events in microcontrollers. It is useful for scheduling tasks at precise intervals without blocking the main program flow.

## UI
UI stands for User Interface. This library typically contains components and tools necessary for building graphical user interfaces, often used in conjunction with other libraries like LVGL or TFT_eSPI.

## Wire
Wire is a library for I2C communication, commonly used in Arduino projects. It facilitates communication between the microcontroller and I2C devices such as sensors, displays, and other peripherals.

## XPT2046_Touchscreen
XPT2046_Touchscreen is a library for interfacing with touch screens based on the XPT2046 controller. It provides functions to read touch coordinates and manage touch events.

## lv_conf.h
lv_conf.h is a configuration file for the LVGL library. It contains settings and options that customize the behavior and performance of LVGL according to the specific requirements of your project.
